# ActLike

Most JS libs these days use the class attribute to attach funtionality
to DOM Elements. This is with good reason: It's fast! But if we don't 
care about speed, how would we want it to work? Peronally I would like
a custom attribute that defines how a DOM element should act. 

Hense: actlike.js.

## Usage

    <div actlike="Example.button"> Click Here </div>

The div above will be given to the constructor of Example.button.

Checkout the examples folder for a full example.

## Features

* No dependencies
* Simple
* JS Sanity
